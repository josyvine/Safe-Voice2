    <string name="disclaimer_text">
        Welcome to Safe Voice.\n\n
        Before you proceed, you MUST understand and agree to the following terms:\n\n
        1.  <b>Always-On Service:</b> To function correctly, Safe Voice runs a service in the background at all times to listen for the voice trigger "Help Help". This will consume a small amount of battery.\n\n
        2.  <b>Emergency Actions:</b> When triggered, this app will automatically attempt to:\n
            - Call your primary emergency contact.\n
            - Send SMS messages to all your emergency contacts.\n\n
        3.  <b>Location Data:</b> The emergency SMS will include a link to your device\'s current location, obtained via GPS. Your location is ONLY accessed and shared when an emergency is triggered.\n\n
        4.  <b>Permissions:</b> The app requires access to your Microphone, Location, Phone, and SMS to perform its core functions. It cannot work without these permissions.\n\n
        5.  <b>Not a Replacement:</b> This app is a supplementary tool and is NOT a replacement for official emergency services (like 911, 112, etc.). Always contact official services directly if you can.\n\n
        6.  <b>No Guarantee:</b> The reliability of this app depends on factors outside of our control, including device performance, battery level, operating system restrictions, network signal, and GPS availability. We are not liable for any failure of the app to perform as expected in an emergency.\n\n
        By clicking "Accept &amp; Continue", you acknowledge these terms and agree to use Safe Voice at your own risk.
